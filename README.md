## files used
key/key and key/key.pub are used for internal jwts for this service. You can use key/make_key.sh to generate these, or otherwise add your own

## User property variables
These are set in userFunction and injected into the token.

userType -- Null, Editor, Admin as userTypes (e.g. Admin can create users, Editor can create marks, Null can't create anything except logs)

userFilter -- list of values which must be present in given field in filtered data responses

### Special filter values
\*\* -- immune to filters (can see everything)
Public -- users with no userFilter are assigned this filter
An item with no filter value is returned in all cases, and is thus also public.
